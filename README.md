2. Start the application.
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
4. Log in using your username and password.
5. Navigate through the application to register cars, view GPS data, and see toll charges.

## Files:
1. `app (2).py`: Python script for the Flask application.
2. `car_detail (1).html`: HTML file, likely displaying car details.
3. `forgot_password.html`: HTML file for handling password recovery.
4. `index (3).html`: HTML file, possibly another version of the index page.
5. `index.html`: Main HTML file for the index or home page.
6. `login.csv`: CSV file containing login details.
7. `login.html`: HTML file for the login page.
