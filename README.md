## How It Works

1. **Car Registration**: Register your car in the system.
2. **GPS Tracking**: The system tracks the location of registered cars using GPS data.
3. **Toll Calculation**: Tolls are calculated based on the location of the car.

## How to Use

1. Open the project directory on your computer.
2. Start the application.
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
4. Log in using your username and password.
5. Navigate through the application to register cars, view GPS data, and see toll charges.
