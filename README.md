# GPS_Toll_based_simulation_in_python
A Python-based simulation of a GPS-based toll collection system using SimPy, Geopandas, Shapely, and Geopy for vehicle movement, toll zone detection, toll calculation, and payment processing.

# GPS Toll-Based Simulation in Python

This project simulates a toll-based system using GPS data to track vehicle movement and calculate toll charges based on the vehicle's location. The application is built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Werkzeug
